  "description": {
    "main_description": "Part 5 consists of a text, followed by six 4-option multiple-choice questions which test the understanding of content and text organisation. The text may be taken from, for example, a modern novel or an article. Questions may focus on the main ideas or details in the text, and on the attitudes or opinions expressed. Candidates may also be asked to deduce the meaning of a word or phrase and to demonstrate understanding of references, such as pronouns, within the text. Additionally, questions may focus on the tone of the text or the writer's purpose, as well as the use of exemplification or comparison. These questions may require candidates to infer the meaning from clues in the text, a skill which is an essential part of reading ability.",
    "question_order": "The 4-option multiple-choice questions are presented in the same order as the information in the text so that candidates can follow the development of the writer's ideas as they work through the questions. The final question may require candidates to interpret an aspect of the text as a whole."
