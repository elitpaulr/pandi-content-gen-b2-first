      "title": "Island Visit",
      "text": "We live on the island of Islay. It's about four kilometres long and two kilometres wide at its broadest point, and it's joined to the mainland by a causeway called the Strand - a narrow road with sea on the south of the line which appears as from the rest of the mainland. Most of the time you wouldn't know we're on an island because the few inches between us and the mainland is just a vast stretch of tall grasses and brown mud. But when there's a high tide she the water rises a half a metre or so above the road and nothing can pass until the tide goes out again a few hours later. Then you know it's an island.\n\nWe were on our way back from the mainland. My older brother, Dominic, had just finished his first year at university in a town 150 km away. Dominic's train was due in at five and he'd asked for a lift back from the station. Now, Dad normally takes being disturbed when he's telling which is just about all the time - very badly. Having to go anywhere, but despite the typical signs and moans - 'Why can't he get a taxi?' - he'd agreed to collect Dominic. I went along too, though I can't remember why. I must have been about fourteen at the time.\n\nSo, anyway, Dad and I had driven to the mainland and picked up Dominic from the station. He had been talking non-stop from the moment I had seen him except for the occasional pause to draw his next breath. Dad was being unusually patient, though, making encouraging noises. When I had finally managed to get a word in, I had found him strangely distant. It wasn't like him to be so uncommunicative. I mean talking is an absorbing force in our family. I don't like it - the way he spoke and waved his hands around as if he was some kind of intellectual or something. It was embarrassing. It made me feel uncomfortable - that kind of discomfort you feel when someone you like, someone close to you, suddenly starts acting like a complete idiot. And I didn't like the way he was grinning like either. I'm all for smirking (I was getting) I might as well not have been there. I felt a bit angry at my own rat.\n\nAs we approached the island on that Friday afternoon, the tide was high and the island welcomed us with stretched out arms as clear and dry. Beautifully hazy in the heat - a dead heat of a summer bound by white sunshine and a blue horizon. We had might decided to take the scenic route home, along the coastal path. The car windows were down and a gentle breeze was getting into the car. The sun light as a smile on a girl and in the afternoon which fades through to the early evening.\n\nWe were about halfway along when Dad pulled up. He did so very suddenly and Dad's not like that. Dad's very smooth. There's nothing but small cottages, farmland, heathland and the road. So strangers don't walk because of that. If they're going to Malvern they tend to take the bus. So the only pedestrians you're likely to see around here are walkers or bird-watchers. But even from a distance I could tell that the figure ahead didn't fit into either of these categories. I wasn't sure how I knew. I just did.\n\nAs we drew closer, he became clearer. He was actually a young man rather than a boy. Although he was on the land side, he wasn't as slight as I'd first thought. He wasn't exactly muscular, but he wasn't exactly looking after the hard to explain. There was a sense of strength about him, a peculiar strength that showed in his features, the way he held himself, the way he walked.",

      "title": "Kombat Kate",
      "text": "There must be few occasions when it would be really rude to refuse an invitation to beat that person up - but I'm in one of those right now. I'm in a basement room in a theatre with a group of women and we're fighting. Kicking, punching, slapping, elbowing, kneeing - the lot. But fear not: No-one's getting hurt because we're all actors and this is a stage combat class. I'm my instructor, I got it right. 'That was good,' says Maria. Now.\n\nImagine there's a pit cam in my shoulder,' she says. 'Now try to block it off. I turn my head a bit instructed, and she's satisfied. 'Much better,' she says. 'You're going to have to practise that move a lot.' I'm holding my face. To my amazement, I got it right. That was good.\n\nWelcome to the world of stage combat. Kate is showing me how some fight each other without getting hit, and she's showing me how to be a good screen agent in an attack. 'I think that's enough for today,' she says to the class. 'We'll do some more next week.' I'm exhausted but happy.\n\nFighting on stage is much more difficult than you'd think. You have to make sure that every move you make looks real but doesn't actually hurt anyone. It's like a dance - you have to get the steps right and make them look natural. You also have to make sure that you're not too close to your partner, or you might accidentally hit them.\n\nOne of the lessons we've learned today is how to make noise of pain appear real - you know, the kind of noise you make when you're hit or kicked. When the make requires a bit of noise, we have to make sure that we're not too loud or too soft. We also have to make sure that we're making the right kind of noise for the right kind of hit.\n\nBut she does in the following part taught the several types of a drama college before going into stunt work. The play she's currently working on is a big production and she's been working hard to get everything right. She's been teaching us how to make our moves look real without actually hurting anyone.\n\nKate explains that getting much information is possible about what I'm eventually doing while telling a dramatic story on a lot of it is useful. But she says what I'm eventually doing while telling a dramatic story on a lot of it is useful. Qualifying to teach it would be a long and difficult process.\n\nUltimately, of course, a stage fight is all hands and mirrors. In real-world, Kate shows me how an actor comes at me with a stage punch. When the stage requires a bit of noise, we have to make sure that we're not too loud or too soft. We also have to make sure that we're making the right kind of noise for the right kind of hit.\n\nIn the enclosed room, I can't resist asking Kate how she thinks she would fare in a real fight. 'I think I would be all right,' she says. 'I only know how to fake it, I can't help thinking, however, that she's just being rather modest.'",
