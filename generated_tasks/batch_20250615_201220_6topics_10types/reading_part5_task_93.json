With the rise of blockchain technology, cryptocurrency has become increasingly popular as a decentralized alternative to traditional currencies.\n\n**How Does Cryptocurrency Work?**\n\nCryptocurrency works on a peer-to-peer network, where transactions are recorded on a public ledger called a blockchain. This decentralized system allows users to send and receive funds without the need for intermediaries, making it faster and cheaper than traditional payment methods.\n\nWhen you create an account with a cryptocurrency exchange, you can buy or sell cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), or Litecoin (LTC). The value of these currencies fluctuates constantly, depending on supply and demand. You can use them to purchase goods and services online, just like regular money.\n\n**Types of Cryptocurrency**\n\nThere are thousands of different types of cryptocurrency out there, each with its own unique features and uses.
